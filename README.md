- Research fundamental OS concepts such as memory management, process scheduling, and file systems.
- Develop a modular and open-source OS from scratch.
- Experiment with bootloader design, kernel architecture, and system calls.
- Explore low-level programming, including assembly and C for os development.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
* Submit research findings or experiments.
* Improve structure.
* Fix bugs and suggest optimizations.
* Propose new ideas for OS features and architecture.

## Contact
